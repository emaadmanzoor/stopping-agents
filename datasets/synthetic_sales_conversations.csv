10057_56,0,38.52,43.2,"Understood. If I may reassure you, there’s no provider switch—your local utility still delivers and services the power. The only change is the discount and the lower rate we apply.",no sale
10057_56,1,43.6,47.7,I see. It's just that I recently renegotiated my rate directly with Central Power and they told me they had the best one for my area.,no sale

200370_7,0,23.68,27.74,"Right now, I see you pay about $65 monthly, and your average rate is closer to $0.15 per kilowatt-hour, so this plan will lower your bill noticeably.",sale
200370_7,1,28.21,31.74,"Is there any kind of contract or penalty if I need to cancel, or hidden fees?",sale
200370_7,0,32.12,37.89,"No penalty at all—you're free to switch plans anytime and there are zero hidden fees. We believe in total transparency. You get the discount for as long as you're on the plan, and can leave whenever you like.",sale

60324_24,0,34.35,38.0,"Exactly. Same service, same reliability, just more money in your pocket. For example, your average bill is $94 per month—on the new plan, you'd save about $120 a year.",sale
60324_24,1,38.22,40.48,Interesting. Do you lock in the rate or will it go up after a while?,sale
60324_24,0,40.65,45.99,"Great question. Your discounted rate and the $7/month credit are guaranteed for 12 months. After that, we’ll review your status and extend further loyalty perks whenever you remain a customer.",sale
60324_24,1,46.25,48.9,That sounds reasonable. What do you need from me if I want to switch?,sale

It’s completely contract-free, so you can leave anytime. Would you like to hear more about how it'll work with your current service?",sale

10532_25,0,28.06,32.29,"Nope—no installation fees or equipment changes are needed. You’ll keep the same service and billing, just at the lower rate. The only thing that changes is the price you pay.",sale

10532_25,0,36.57,41.23,"Of course. You're currently paying about 18 cents per kWh. With our plan, it drops to roughly 15.3 cents—and that $50 credit comes off your first statement.",sale

39841_55,1,31.27,32.03,"Okay, what would my new rate be?",sale
39841_55,0,32.52,37.65,"Your per kWh rate would drop to 14.3 cents, and your loyalty bonus would take your typical bill down to about $98 a month based on your current usage. You'd see these savings reflected on your next statement.",sale
39841_55,1,38.32,39.1,And will my provider change?,sale
39841_55,0,39.52,43.73,"Nope, your electricity delivery and service will stay exactly the same—no change or interruptions. We just set your new discounted rate with your current provider.",sale

58742_56,1,24.96,28.2,That's interesting. $9 every month sounds good. Is there a catch—like a minimum usage requirement?,sale
58742_56,0,28.65,34.27,"No catch at all. Even if your usage is lower than average, that discount is yours. Plus, the rate is locked in for the first 9 months, so you’re shielded from market spikes.",sale
58742_56,1,34.46,37.91,"Nice. Do I need to change anything on my end, like with my current supplier, or does this happen automatically?",sale
58742_56,0,38.19,44.04,Great question. You won’t experience any interruption—Riverside Energy will handle the transfer for you. You’ll still get your power through the same lines and meters and receive one clear bill from us instead.,sale

54122_63,1,21.52,22.96,Maybe. Can you tell me how this is different from what I have now?,sale
54122_63,0,23.3,27.99,"Absolutely. I checked your account—you’re on a standard variable rate, paying around 17 cents per kWh. With Saver Plus, you’d be paying 14.9 cents, plus get that flat $5 discount, guaranteed for 12 months.",sale
54122_63,1,28.1,30.15,And I don’t have to switch utility companies?,sale
54122_63,0,30.44,33.02,"Correct—your power stays with CityGrid, we just provide the savings on supply. Billing still comes from CityGrid for convenience.",sale
54122_63,1,33.6,36.16,How soon would I see the discount on my bill?,sale
54122_63,0,36.34,40.46,"Usually, your next bill reflects the lower rate—sometimes it takes one cycle, but most customers see it within 30 days.",sale

29854_64,1,30.41,32.75,That’s good to know. Would my current discounts disappear if I switch?,sale
29854_64,0,33.16,37.42,"You’d keep your current loyalty rewards, and these new discounts add on top. All you need to do is confirm your address and billing details, and I’ll process the switch for you.",sale
29854_64,1,37.9,40.09,That makes sense. Can you tell me my new rate per kilowatt hour?,sale

29854_64,1,45.01,46.66,I like the sound of that. What do you need from me to get started?,sale
29854_64,0,47.19,51.88,"Just to confirm, is your billing address still 125 Lakeview Drive, here in town?",sale
29854_64,1,52.12,53.87,"Yes, that's correct. Everything else is the same, including my contact email.",sale
29854_64,0,54.22,59.46,Perfect. I’ll take care of the transition and you’ll get a confirmation email within 24 hours. The discounts kick in on your next billing cycle. Is there anything else I can answer before we finalize?,sale

24501_65,0,16.23,21.61,"Great question! Compared to your current variable-rate plan, this new plan locks in a lower rate for all hours with no surprise increases, plus it bundles a 20% instant discount on your supply charges for 12 months—no fees or long-term contract.",sale
24501_65,1,21.97,25.59,"Interesting. So what would I actually pay per kilowatt? I’ve seen a lot of offers, but there’s always something extra in the fine print.",sale
24501_65,0,26.0,32.31,"Absolutely, transparency is really important. Your new rate would be $0.13 per kilowatt-hour, including all regular fees except government taxes, and you’ll save 20% off the supply charge line every month. Our team monitors the market, so if prices drop, yours drops too.",sale
24501_65,1,32.9,36.53,"And I don’t have to switch providers or lose power during the change, right?",sale

24501_65,1,46.72,49.83,"Okay, that actually sounds pretty good. There’s no penalty if I change my mind down the line?",sale
24501_65,0,50.19,54.82,"Not at all—there’s zero cancellation fee, and you can change back or move to another plan whenever you need. The goal here is to keep our loyal customers happy and saving year-round.",sale
