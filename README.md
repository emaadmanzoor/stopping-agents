*Language agents for optimal stopping*

Stopping agents are language agents — large language models that
generate *decisions* — specialized for optimal stopping of conversations.
Specifically, stopping agents observe the ongoing conversation text and
make sequential `wait` or `quit` decisions that optimally tradeoff between waiting
to accumulate more information and incurring waiting costs.

For more details on the underlying theory and reference implementation, check out our website at [stoppingagents.com](https://stoppingagents.com/)
and our paper on [learning when to quit in sales conversations](#).

As an example of what you can build with stopping agents, below is a demo of stopping agents in action on a recorded sales call (the code for this application is [here](https://github.com/emaadmanzoor/stopping-agents/tree/main/app)):
